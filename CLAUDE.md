## ðŸ“š Onboarding

At the start of each session, read:
1. Any `README.md` docs across the project
2. Any `README.*.md` docs across the project

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Implementation should match the specifications exactly
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
3. **Keep It Simple**: Keep code deliberately minimal - avoid over-engineering
4. **Pure Functions**: Core logic should be pure functions without side effects
