# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on the SpecTree project.

## ðŸ“š Onboarding

At the start of each session, read:
1. All `README.md` and `README.*.md` files throughout the project
2. All `TESTING.*.md` files for test specifications

## ðŸ’¡ Key Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Implementation should match the specifications exactly
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
3. **Keep It Simple**: SpecTree is intentionally minimal - avoid over-engineering
4. **Pure Functions**: Core logic should be pure functions without side effects
